GOALS

TimeBom aims to be a versatile engine, be it to run on someones Mac when they have some downtime, or in some of the biggest eSports games ever.

To complete this goal, it is set to support multiple devices, the majority of the desktop gaming market, from day one.

It's meant to be a developers best friend, and to do so, it aims to have an easy way to import and package audios, as well as to sculpt a model. These tabs are seperated, and able to be mixed and matched.

Early builds are expected to be unoptimized, but as its developed, it should eventaully support RTX, and anti-alaising, as well as different frame rates. 

Scripting is set to be the most difficult task currently, so the best course of action would be to begin with a simple render, a 3d square, and go from there.
